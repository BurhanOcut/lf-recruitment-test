# Bike Shop API

This project contains part of a simple .NET application for a Bike Shop.

The project has a handful of initial tests, three of which are failing due to bugs in the code. 

The test spec is correct, but we need to fix the bugs!

The repository and folder structure is not standardized and makes it harder to work through and needs to be fixed.

As an interview challenge, we'd like you to apply clean architecture and SOLID principles and make the project more maintainable and extensible for further development.

## Getting Started
 *  Build the project using `dotnet build`
 *  Run the tests using `dotnet test`

## Objectives
 * Bugs are fixed
 * Diagram for reference architecture
 * Improved repository and structure
 * Clean architecture applied
 * SOLID principles applied
